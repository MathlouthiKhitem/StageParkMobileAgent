# parkmobile
while in this internship, we made a parking management flutter cross platform application, to automate it management using the current location and:two variations of the app, one for the client to reserve a place in the parking and pay and check his paiement have noticed if his time has almost run out, and an app for the agent if there is a car or vehicle that didn't pay to take it out of the parking, finally an admin dashboard to manage the parkings, locations payments methods, and payments amount and to manage the agents using angular as a front end. for this three apps we created a java spring backend server managing all of them.


A new Flutter project.
